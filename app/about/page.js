        <strong>JobCat.in</strong> is not just another job listing site — it’s a step toward making
        career information simple, trustworthy, and personal.

      <p className="mb-4">
        We know what it’s like to miss an opportunity because a detail was lost,
        or to scroll endlessly through noise just to find one real update.
        That’s why JobCat was born — to bring clarity to every seeker’s journey.

        🚀 Our Mission
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To make job and scholarship information transparent, fast, and easy to access — 
        for every student, graduate, and dreamer who wants to move forward.

      <p className="mb-4">
        We believe technology can serve humans, not overwhelm them.
        Each notification, each update, and each improvement on JobCat is crafted with care —
        so your focus stays where it belongs: <strong>on growth, not confusion.</strong>
